#
#  "A problem well-defined is a problem half-solved."
#
#  This phase is about CLARITY. Before any analysis, you must know:
#    - WHO cares about this problem?
#    - WHAT questions are we answering?
#    - HOW will we know if we succeeded?
#    - WHAT decisions will this analysis inform?
#
# ============================================================================

"""
WHY THIS PHASE MATTERS
======================

Most failed analyses fail HERE, not in the statistics.

Common Phase 1 failures:
  ❌ "I'll just explore the data and see what I find"
     → Leads to aimless wandering, no actionable insights
  
  ❌ "The stakeholder said they want to reduce defaults"
     → Too vague. Reduce by how much? For which customers? At what cost?
  
  ❌ "I'll build the best model I can"
     → Best by what metric? Who will use it? How will it be deployed?

What good Phase 1 looks like:
  ✓ Clear stakeholders with defined concerns
  ✓ Specific, answerable questions
  ✓ Success criteria you can measure
  ✓ Decisions that will be made based on findings

# STEP 1.1: IDENTIFY STAKEHOLDERS
# ============================================================================
"""
WHAT IS A STAKEHOLDER?
----------------------
Anyone who:
  - Has the problem you're solving
  - Will use your findings
  - Will make decisions based on your analysis
  - Is affected by those decisions
  - Needs to approve or validate your work

WHY IDENTIFY THEM?
------------------
Different stakeholders care about different things:

  - CFO cares about: "How much money will we lose?"
  - Risk Manager cares about: "Which customers are risky?"
  - Marketing cares about: "Who should we target/avoid?"
  - Collections cares about: "Who should we call first?"
  - Compliance cares about: "Is this model fair and explainable?"
  - IT cares about: "Can we actually deploy this?"

Your analysis must speak to YOUR stakeholder's concerns.

HOW TO THINK THROUGH THIS:
--------------------------
Ask yourself these questions:

1. WHO has the problem?
   "Who is losing sleep over credit card defaults?"
   → The Risk Manager, the CFO, the Board

2. WHO will read my analysis?
   "Who will actually look at my report/dashboard?"
   → Risk Manager (primary), maybe executives (summary only)

3. WHO will make decisions?
   "Who has the authority to change lending policy?"
   → Risk Manager recommends, Credit Committee approves

4. WHO is affected by those decisions?
   "If we tighten lending, who feels the impact?"
   → Customers (denied credit), Sales (fewer loans), Bank (less risk but less revenue)

5. WHO needs to trust my work?
   "Who needs to validate my methodology?"
   → Compliance, Model Validation team, Auditors

THE CORE SKILL
--------------
Converting vague concerns into specific, answerable questions.

VAGUE: "We want to understand defaults"
  → Understand what about defaults? For what purpose?

SPECIFIC: "What is the default rate for customers with payment delays 
           vs. those without, and is this difference statistically significant?"
  → Clear, measurable, testable

THE FOUR TYPES OF QUESTIONS
---------------------------
Every analytical question falls into one of four categories.
You need questions from EACH category for a complete analysis.

"""

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# DESCRIPTIVE QUESTIONS: "What is happening?"
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"""
PURPOSE: Establish the facts. Measure the current state.

CHARACTERISTICS:
  - Can be answered with counts, percentages, averages
  - No interpretation or causation
  - Backward-looking (what happened, what is)
  - Foundation for all other analysis

HOW TO THINK:
  "If I had to describe this problem with just numbers, what would I report?"
  "What are the basic facts someone needs to know?"

QUESTION PATTERNS:
  - What is the [metric]?
  - How many [things] are there?
  - What percentage of [group] has [characteristic]?
  - What is the distribution of [variable]?
  - What is the average/median [measure]?
  - How has [metric] changed over time?

FOR CREDIT CARD DEFAULT - EXAMPLE QUESTIONS:

  1. What is the overall default rate?
     → "22% of customers defaulted"
     
  2. How many customers are in each education category?
     → "47% university, 35% grad school, 16% high school, 2% other"
     
  3. What is the average credit limit?
     → "NT$167,484 (median: NT$140,000)"
     
  4. What is the distribution of payment delays?
     → "65% never delayed, 20% delayed once, 15% delayed 2+ times"
     
  5. What is the default rate by age group?
     → "Under 30: 25%, 30-50: 21%, Over 50: 19%"

WHAT STATISTICAL METHODS ANSWER THESE?
  - Counts and frequencies
  - Means, medians, standard deviations
  - Percentages and proportions
  - Histograms, bar charts
  - Cross-tabulations

YOUR DESCRIPTIVE QUESTIONS:
Write 3-5 descriptive questions for the Taiwan dataset.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS: "Why is it happening?"
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"""
PURPOSE: Find explanations. Identify relationships and drivers.

CHARACTERISTICS:
  - Looks for associations and correlations
  - Compares groups to find differences
  - Seeks to explain patterns found in descriptive analysis
  - Still backward-looking, but interpretive

HOW TO THINK:
  "Now that I know WHAT is happening, WHY might it be happening?"
  "What factors are associated with the outcome?"
  "Are there differences between groups that explain the pattern?"

QUESTION PATTERNS:
  - Why is [metric] high/low?
  - What factors are associated with [outcome]?
  - Is there a relationship between [X] and [Y]?
  - Do [group A] and [group B] differ on [measure]?
  - What distinguishes [success] from [failure]?
  - What drives [behavior]?

FOR CREDIT CARD DEFAULT - EXAMPLE QUESTIONS:

  1. Is payment delay associated with default?
     → Tests relationship between payment behavior and outcome
     
  2. Do defaulters have different credit limits than non-defaulters?
     → Compares means between two groups
     
  3. Is there a relationship between age and default?
     → Tests correlation or group differences
     
  4. Which factor has the strongest association with default?
     → Ranks predictors by effect size
     
  5. Why is the default rate higher for customers with low credit limits?
     → Investigates a specific pattern

WHAT STATISTICAL METHODS ANSWER THESE?
  - Correlation analysis (Pearson, Spearman)
  - Chi-square test (association between categorical variables)
  - T-tests (comparing means between groups)
  - ANOVA (comparing means across multiple groups)
  - Effect sizes (Cramér's V, Cohen's d)

IMPORTANT DISTINCTION:
  Diagnostic questions find ASSOCIATIONS, not CAUSATION.
  
  ✓ "Payment delay is associated with default"
  ✗ "Payment delay causes default"
  
  We can't prove causation with observational data.
  But associations guide decisions and further investigation.

YOUR DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS:
Write 3-5 diagnostic questions for the Taiwan dataset.

# PREDICTIVE QUESTIONS: "What will happen?"
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"""
PURPOSE: Forecast future outcomes. Score or classify new cases.

CHARACTERISTICS:
  - Forward-looking
  - Uses patterns from past to predict future
  - Produces probabilities, scores, or classifications
  - Requires a model (statistical or machine learning)

HOW TO THINK:
  "Based on what I've learned, can I predict what will happen?"
  "If a new customer walks in tomorrow, can I estimate their risk?"
  "What will happen if current trends continue?"

QUESTION PATTERNS:
  - Can we predict [outcome]?
  - What is the probability of [event] for [entity]?
  - How accurate can our predictions be?
  - Which customers are most likely to [behavior]?
  - What will [metric] be next [time period]?
  - If [condition changes], what will happen to [outcome]?

FOR CREDIT CARD DEFAULT - EXAMPLE QUESTIONS:

  1. Can we predict which customers will default?
     → Binary classification model
     
  2. What is the probability of default for a given customer?
     → Probability scoring (logistic regression output)
     
  3. How accurately can we identify defaulters?
     → Model performance metrics (AUC, recall, precision)
     
  4. Which current customers are at highest risk?
     → Apply model to score portfolio
     
  5. If a customer has 2 payment delays, what's their default probability?
     → Use model for specific scenarios

WHAT STATISTICAL METHODS ANSWER THESE?
  - Logistic regression (binary classification)
  - Decision trees / Random forests
  - Model evaluation metrics (AUC-ROC, confusion matrix)
  - Cross-validation
  - Probability calibration

KEY METRICS FOR PREDICTIVE MODELS:
  - AUC-ROC: Overall discriminatory power (0.5 = random, 1.0 = perfect)
  - Recall: Of actual defaults, how many did we catch?
  - Precision: Of predicted defaults, how many were correct?
  - KS Statistic: Maximum separation between classes

  2. Which customers should we target for early intervention?
     → "Contact customers with 2+ delays immediately"
     
  3. Should we reject applicants with certain characteristics?
     → "Require minimum payment history of 6 months"
     
  4. What's the optimal threshold for flagging high-risk customers?
     → "Flag customers with >40% predicted default probability"
     
  5. How should we price credit based on risk?

# ============================================================================
# STEP 1.3: FORMULATE HYPOTHESES
# ============================================================================
"""
WHAT IS A HYPOTHESIS?
---------------------
A specific, testable statement about what you expect to find.

WHY FORMULATE HYPOTHESES?
-------------------------
1. Forces you to think BEFORE you analyze
2. Prevents "fishing" for any pattern you can find
3. Makes your analysis defensible ("I planned to test this")
4. Separates exploration from confirmation

THE STRUCTURE OF A HYPOTHESIS
-----------------------------
Every formal hypothesis has:

  NULL HYPOTHESIS (H₀): 
    The "nothing interesting" statement
    What you assume is true unless proven otherwise
    Usually: "no difference" or "no relationship"
    
  ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS (H₁):
    What you're trying to demonstrate
    The "something interesting" statement
    Usually: "there IS a difference" or "there IS a relationship"

EXAMPLES:

  Question: "Do defaulters have lower credit limits?"
  
  H₀: Mean credit limit of defaulters = Mean credit limit of non-defaulters
  H₁: Mean credit limit of defaulters ≠ Mean credit limit of non-defaulters
  
  Test: Independent samples t-test
  
  ---
  
  Question: "Is payment delay associated with default?"
  
  H₀: Payment delay status and default are independent
  H₁: Payment delay status and default are associated
  
  Test: Chi-square test of independence
  
  ---
  
  Question: "Is the default rate higher for males than females?"
  
  H₀: p_male = p_female (default rates are equal)
  H₁: p_male ≠ p_female (default rates differ)
  
  Test: Two-proportion z-test

HOW TO THINK ABOUT HYPOTHESES:
------------------------------
Turn each diagnostic question into a testable hypothesis:

  Question                          → Hypothesis
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  "Is X associated with Y?"         → H₀: X and Y are independent
                                      H₁: X and Y are associated
  
  "Do groups differ on measure?"    → H₀: μ₁ = μ₂
                                      H₁: μ₁ ≠ μ₂
  
  "Is rate higher for group A?"     → H₀: p_A = p_B
                                      H₁: p_A > p_B (one-tailed)
  
  "Is there a correlation?"         → H₀: ρ = 0
                                      H₁: ρ ≠ 0

WHY DEFINE SUCCESS UPFRONT?
---------------------------
If you don't define success before analyzing, you'll rationalize 
whatever you find as "good enough."

BAD: "Our model is 78% accurate" 
     → Is that good? Compared to what?

GOOD: "Our model achieves 78% accuracy, exceeding our target of 75% 
       and beating the baseline of 70%"
     → Clear benchmark, clear success

HOW TO THINK ABOUT SUCCESS:
---------------------------
For each type of question, define what "good" looks like:

DESCRIPTIVE SUCCESS:
  - All key metrics calculated
  - Data quality issues identified and documented
  - Clear picture of current state
  
DIAGNOSTIC SUCCESS:
  - Key relationships identified
  - Effect sizes calculated (not just p-values!)
  - Top 3-5 predictive factors ranked
  
PREDICTIVE SUCCESS:
  - Model performance exceeds baseline
  - Model performance meets minimum threshold
  - Model is interpretable and makes business sense
  
PRESCRIPTIVE SUCCESS:
  - Recommendations are specific and actionable
  - Expected impact is quantified
  - Trade-offs are acknowledged

└─────────────────┴───────────┴───────────┴───────────┘

WHAT IS THE BASELINE?
--------------------
The simplest possible approach. Your model must beat this.

For classification with 78% non-default:
  - Baseline accuracy: 78% (just predict majority class)
  - Baseline AUC: 0.50 (random guessing)
  
For a useful model, you need:
  - Better than majority class prediction
  - AUC significantly above 0.50

# ============================================================================
# STEP 1.5: SCOPE AND CONSTRAINTS
# ============================================================================
"""
WHAT ARE WE INCLUDING AND EXCLUDING?
------------------------------------
Being explicit about scope prevents scope creep and sets expectations.

IN SCOPE:
  ✓ Exploratory data analysis of all 23 predictors
  ✓ Statistical testing of 5-8 hypotheses
  ✓ Logistic regression model for default prediction
  ✓ Model evaluation and interpretation
  ✓ Business recommendations based on findings
  
OUT OF SCOPE (for now):
  ✗ Real-time deployment of model
  ✗ Advanced ML models (XGBoost, neural networks)
  ✗ Causal inference (proving causation)
  ✗ External data integration
  ✗ Time series analysis (only 6 months of data)

KNOWN CONSTRAINTS:
  - Data is from 2005 Taiwan (may not generalize)
  - No income data available
  - Limited to credit card customers (not all loan types)
  - Cross-sectional data (one snapshot, not longitudinal)

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
  - Can't prove causation, only association
  - Can't generalize to other markets without validation
  - Definition of "default" may differ from other contexts
  - 22% default rate is unusually high
