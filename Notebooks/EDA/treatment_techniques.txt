# Problem:
1. The education has 3 missing categories, 0, 5, 6. Lets fix 3 of them.

1.1:
# The size of category 0 is small 14 ppl, 0.05%, so could be:
- missing data coded as 0, 
- data entry error
- Legit but udocumented.

1.1.1: Let us loot at their repayment behaviour
:: -2: Did not use the card. Have enough money to spend, do not need bank money.
:: -1: Paid On time, full amount.
:: 0: Minimum payment.
 We are here so to see if most of them are less than 1. If yes they have financial stability.



1.2: About the edu_sample of 14 ppl
- 0.05% of the sample
- no defaults
- The default rate of the sample is 22%, but here there is nothing. If we were to apply this, 22%, there should have been 3 ppl.
- It has 2nd highest credit limit.
- we can see that this group has highest % of payment status less than 1.
